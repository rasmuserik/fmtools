# Contributing

We use [github issues](https://github.com/solsort/mobibl/issues) to keep track of the project. 

Feel free to create new issues, or start working on existing issues.

All kinds of contributions are welcome, including:

- testing the app and reporting bugs
- design and graphics
- improvement of user experience
- writing documentation
- ideas for features, use cases, etc.
- coding

Labels are used to make it easier to find tasks within different areas.
If you cannot find a task that fits you, feel free to make one, or create an issue about a task missing within the area you would like to contribute in.

## Workflow

We use the following labels to keep track of issue status.

- `open` means that it should be ready to work on, and anybody are welcome to start looking into it. If it is not clear what the first task of the issue is, make a quick comment and ask "how do I start?" or something similar.
- `in progress` means that somebody is working on it at the moment.
- `ready` are pull requests, and means that the feature is implemented, and ready to be merged into the main project. Best practice is to let somebody else merge it, thereby sharing knowledge and having an extra pair of eyes looking at it.

A board of current issues can be seen on [waffle.io](https://waffle.io/solsort/mobibl). 

Techincal tips: create a feature branch to work on the feature with `git checkout -b 42-some-issue-description` where 42 is the issue number. This automatically assigns the issue to you, and move it to `in progress`. If the commit fixing the issue includes the text `fixes #42` this will auto-close the issue when the pull-request is merged.


## Coding

The first version is a HTML5-app using React. Later on we might add native UIs using React-native, while keeping the logic.

We use [re-frame](https://github.com/Day8/re-frame) to structure the app, and it is written in ClojureScript.
